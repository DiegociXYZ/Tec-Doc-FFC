        <p>Welcome to Blender! Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation suite.</p>
        <p>With Blender, you can create 3D visualizations such as still images, 3D animations and VFX shots. You can also edit videos. It is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.</p>
        <p>Being a cross-platform application, Blender runs on Linux, macOS, as well as Windows systems. It also has relatively small memory and drive requirements compared to other 3D creation suites. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience across all supported hardware and platforms.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Blender is a fully integrated 3D content creation suite, offering a broad range of essential tools, including Modeling, Rendering, Animation & Rigging, Video Editing, VFX, Compositing, Texturing, and many types of Simulations.</li>
          <li>It is cross platform, with an OpenGL GUI that is uniform on all major platforms (and customizable with Python scripts).</li>
          <li>It has a high-quality 3D architecture, enabling fast and efficient creation workflow.</li>
          <li>It boasts active community support. See blender.org/community for an extensive list of sites.</li>
          <li>It has a small executable, which is optionally portable.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>You can download the latest version of Blender <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/">here</a>.</code>

        <p>In 1988, Ton Roosendaal co-founded the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo. NeoGeo quickly became the largest 3D animation studio in the Netherlands and one of the leading animation houses in Europe. NeoGeo created award-winning productions (European Corporate Video Awards 1993 and 1995) for large corporate clients such as the multinational electronics company Philips. Within NeoGeo, Ton was responsible for both art direction and internal software development. After careful deliberation, Ton decided that the current in-house 3D tool set for NeoGeo was too old and cumbersome to maintain, and needed to be rewritten from scratch. In 1995 this rewrite began and was destined to become the 3D software creation we all know as Blender. As NeoGeo continued to refine and improve Blender, it became apparent to Ton that Blender could be used as a tool for other artists outside of NeoGeo.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Ton decided to found a new company called Not a Number (NaN) as a spin-off of NeoGeo to further market and develop Blender. At the core of NaN was a desire to create and distribute a compact, cross-platform 3D application for free. At the time, this was a revolutionary concept as most commercial 3D applications cost thousands of dollars. NaN hoped to bring professional level 3D modeling and animation tools within the reach of the general computing public. NaN’s business model involved providing commercial products and services around Blender. In 1999 NaN attended its first SIGGRAPH conference in an effort to more widely promote Blender. Blender’s first SIGGRAPH convention was a huge success and gathered a tremendous amount of interest from both the press and attendees. Blender was a hit and its huge potential confirmed!</p>

        <p>Blender is released approximately every three months. You can keep up to date with the latest changes through the release notes.</p>
        <p>Blender is available for download on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Always check that the graphics drivers are up to date and that OpenGL is well supported. Blender has a set of minimum and recommended requirements; so make sure these are met before trying to install Blender.

            Support for other hardware such as graphic tablets and 3D mice are covered later in Configuring Hardware.</p>
